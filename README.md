## So who am I? 

Hello there! 

For those of you who are curious, this is a side page dedicated to the person behind the computer screen.

My name is Abbi.  I am a current generation classic rock addict.  My favorite bands include legends such as Def Leppard, Guns N’ Roses, Poison, Bon Jovi, Warrant, Ratt, Van Halen, Motley Crue, and so many more… If You haven’t figured it out yet, I love Def Leppard just a *smidge* more than the others.

# Me elsewhere

This [tumblr](http://rocknrollinmyveins.tumblr.com) is also run by me. This website is a more professional webside. The link above is where I let my creativity side out, you get to see photos and videos of all the bands I love!
