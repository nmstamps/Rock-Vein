#So who IS rocknrollinmyveins anyway?

##Hello there! 

For those of you who are curious, this is a side page dedicated to the person behind the computer screen.  

My name is Abbi.  I am a current generation classic rock addict.  My favorite bands include legends such as Def Leppard, Guns N’ Roses, Poison, Bon Jovi, Warrant, Ratt, Van Halen, Motley Crue, and so many more… If You haven’t figured it out by my fancy slideshow, I love Def Leppard just a *smidge* more than the others.

Okay, they’re pretty much my life. Sue me.

See, to a lot of people, I’m just a wannabe.  I was born in the wrong generation.  No, I didn’t see my favorite bands during their hey days.  I’m the kid who’s looking up whose lead singer is still alive so I can go catch a final tour before they settle into retirement.  I’m the kid who gets everyone’s old record collections that have been sitting in basements and garages for twenty-some years.  I’m the kid who stays up till two in the morning watching old MTV footage.

You know, when MTV still played music.

I’m just a kid trying to relive an era I was never a part of.  I’m okay with that. 

I do like being part of my generation. The technology is insane, video and picture quality is amazing, and so many advances in many aspects of life have been made. However, a bit of me feels like I don’t belong here.  I’m the black sheep.  I think a lot of us on here are.

Which leads me to this question: Why did I start this blog?  Well, initially it was a place to archive my band pictures.  I thought it was a little weird to just save them all on my phone if I wasn’t going to do anything with them.  I didn’t think there’d be an audience for my posts at all…  Till I started searching through tags.  That’s how I found everyone, and how I assume you found me.

We’re all part of this classic rock community.  It’s very diverse; there are those of us, such as myself, who weren’t there for the historical moments but wish they were.  Then there are those of us who were there and love to relive it and share their own stories.  Finally, there are the curious, the newcomers.  They may have heard Living On A Prayer in the grocery store a few times but wouldn’t recognize Jon Bon Jovi if he said hi to them.

No matter what category you belong to, welcome!  I think you’ll enjoy your stroll through the 80s through present day I work to put on my page. My ask box is always open too, for anyone with questions or comments.   The whole point of this blog is to stick it to those who make fun of us for living in the past, to show them that these bands have historical significance because they give us a reason to live and smile each day,.  These bands are who make us who we are.  They have provided the soundtracks of our lives  

Rock ‘n’ roll is not dead.  Even when everyone is long gone and the stage lights have gone down for the last time, we are here to carry on their legacy.

That’s what I stand for.  In a way, maybe even a weird way, I am rock n roll.  It literally feels like it courses through my veins.  Anyways…  Enjoy my blog. ^.^

##P.S.,

Recently I have begun an exciting endeavor!  I am an aspiring writer whose ultimate dream is to one day own/operate/write for her own classic rock magazine and *professional* blog.  I have begun the lengthy process of gathering information so I can begin stockpiling articles, but I need your help!  I need to know what my audience is interested in reading, not just what I myself feel like writing.

While Rocknrollinmyveins is very much 80s-geared, this magazine I am composing will focus on multiple areas and genres.  I’m looking to include everything from Beatles, Sex Pistols, Queen, Bowie, Def Leppard…  ALL the people.  All the bands.  All the favorites.

You can find my original post concerning this adventure of mine here.

Please reblog/send it to your friends, get their opinions, and get back to me about this!  I want to hear from you!  Feel free to drop a message into my inbox, which is always open, if you feel better leaving your suggestions/questions concerning my project.  I will gladly answer any questions, though frankly, this project is very much open to ideas right now, so there aren’t many guidelines.  I’m building the skeleton.

Thank you in advance for helping me with this!  Together, we’re going to be the generation that keeps classic rock alive and relevant.
